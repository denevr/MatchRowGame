INITIALIZING

- Run MainScene in Unity, select a level from popup menu, play that level.
- Once there are no moves left, celebration animation will take place (just for visualisation).


NOTES & MISSING PARTS

UI - I have implemented the Levels button from scratch, without using canvas. However I used a canvas for UI 
elements of the popup menu. 

GAMEPLAY - I ran out of time to implement checkGameOver method and touch controls. Right now, it only checks for 
move count to end the game and show animation demo. Other than that, gameplay works in the way it is supposed to.

LEVEL - First 10 levels are included in the game itself. There are no DLC, network checking, asset bundle 
management.

ANIMATIONS - I created an example tween library animation with a little modification. It shows up when there
are no moves left in a level.

RESOURCES - Background, sprites used in shapes, button pngs are not my work. All credit to the owners.


CONCLUSION

- Due to some unexpected problems, I ran out of time to implement all the missing features about the game. Yet,
I am able to build a much better UI, GUI, animation. Please feel free to ask anything.
